# Cinnamon-Script

Script to Install Chrome, Discord, Zoom, themes to customize Mint, and the Switch emulator with firmware and keys. It works on debian based systems only, and the only desktop enviroments I run are Cinnamon and GNOME. This should hypothetically work on KDE , Cosmic , etc. but the themes may not load properly due to them being solely for Cinnamon.
